# Noir React Native starter

## Description

This is a simple React Native app showcasing how to use Noir in a mobile app (both for iOS and Android) to generate and verify proofs directly on mobile phones.

## Mobile proving

### iOS

The app integrates with the [Swoir library](https://github.com/Swoir/Swoir) to generate proofs with Noir on iOS. The library is written in Swift and is available as a Swift Package.

### Android

As of today, the generation of proofs with Noir on Android is not operational. Support for it will be added soon.

## Current version of Noir supported

The current version of Noir supported by the app is 0.19.4
